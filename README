The refresher

Runs on arduino leonardo compatible boards.
In my case it's a cheap-o chinese knock-off mini Leo compatible board.

Checks a switch whether to do Safari refresh (CMD+R) or refresh for any other browser (F5)

holds key (or combination) for 100mS, then realeases and repeats after eg. 5000mS.

that's it.

Browser automation done in hardware, because why not. :D
